# CNN for Image Classification

## Project Overview

I created this project to implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification. The goal was to classify images into predefined categories using a step-by-step approach, covering dataset preparation, model building, and performance evaluation. CNNs are an exciting and powerful tool in deep learning because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.

## Features of the Project

1. **Dataset Loading**:  
   - I used a dataset containing labeled images.  
   - Images were preprocessed (resized, normalized, and augmented) to improve training efficiency.

2. **Model Architecture**:  
   - I built a CNN model using frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.  
   - The architecture includes convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:  
   - I trained the CNN on the dataset using backpropagation and gradient descent.  
   - Model performance was evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **loss**, and a **confusion matrix**.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - I visualized the training performance (loss and accuracy) using graphs.  
   - Sample predictions were displayed to demonstrate the modelâ€™s classification capabilities.

## Project Steps

1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**  
   - I imported the required libraries and loaded the image dataset.  
   - Preprocessing included resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques.

2. **Build the CNN Model**  
   - I designed the CNN layers, including:  
     - Convolutional layers  
     - Activation layers (ReLU, Softmax)  
     - Pooling layers (MaxPooling)  
     - Fully connected layers  

3. **Train the Model**  
   - I compiled the model and specified loss functions, optimizers, and metrics.  
   - The model was trained on the training dataset for multiple epochs.

4. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - I tested the model on a separate test set and analyzed the results.  
   - Metrics like accuracy were used to measure performance.

5. **Visualize Results**  
   - I plotted accuracy and loss curves.  
   - I also displayed sample predictions, comparing actual labels with predicted labels.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow or PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

   ```

3. Run each cell to:  
   - Load the data  
   - Build the CNN model  
   - Train and evaluate the model  

4. Modify the dataset path or parameters if needed.

## Results

- Achieved accuracy: **XX%** (replace with actual accuracy).
- Sample predictions:  
  | Actual Label | Predicted Label |  
  |--------------|----------------|  
  | Cat          | Cat            |  
  | Dog          | Dog            |  

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with deeper CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).  
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models.  
- Enhance data augmentation techniques.
